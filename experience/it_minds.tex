\cvevent{Software Developer}{IT Minds}{March 2018 -- April 2019}{Aarhus, Denmark}
Consultant providing IT solutions, that improve and automate the client's
workflow. Among my clients have been \emph{LEGO}, where I was working full stack
and was the main architect on the frontend Angular application.

I was the lead architect on the frontend of an internal project, where I
succesfully mentored the new interns, providing feedback on their approaches to
solutions and code quality.

Though more practical, my academic skills and theoretical insights have been
invaluable to identify the effective and elegant solutions.
