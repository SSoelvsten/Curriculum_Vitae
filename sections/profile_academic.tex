Ambitious, versatile and hard-working computer scientists with a deeper interest
for \emph{algorithms}, \emph{complexity theory}, and \emph{logic and semantics}.

A gap year after my bachelor's degree working as a software developer provided
me with a new perspective and new skills. Though more practical, many of the
academic skills and theoretical insights from the university have been
invaluable to find the elegant solutions.
