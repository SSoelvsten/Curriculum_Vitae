\cvevent{Kitchen Responsible}{Regnecentralen, Aarhus University}{May 2017 -- Present}{Aarhus, Denmark}
Regnecentralen is a kitchen and social hub for students. I took care of practical
everyday things, arranged events, created social media content, and am
developing a full stack IoT solution to gate the access to the kitchen.
